I am a Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Department at Cornell University, advised by  [Prof Angelique Taylor](https://www.angeliquemtaylor.com/) and [Prof. Sanjiban Choudhury](https://www.sanjibanchoudhury.com/).
My Ph.D. research investigates techniques to enable safe cooperation and ensure alignment between humans and robots during their collaboration in team settings especially  in safety-critical environments such as hospitals. I am interested in effective human-robot teaming behaviours by learning from demonstrations of human activities and building simulators.

My past research projects range from using a  game-theoretic approach and reinforcement learning algorithm to study emergent persuasiveness in large language agents (LLA) such as GPT-J, dolly GPT-J, ChatGPT and GPT-3 to Explainable AI (XAI) and AI safety.
I completed my Masters in Science of Engineering in the department of Computer Science at [Princeton University (https://www.cs.princeton.edu/)  in United states, 2023 supervised by [Prof. Jaime Fern√°ndez Fisac(https://ece.princeton.edu/people/jaime-fernandez-fisac) . Before that, I received my B.Eng from University of Benin, Nigeria. Before joining Cornell in Summer 2023, I spent eleven weeks as an AI Safety and verification intern doing R&D work at [ Siemens Technology](https://www.siemens.com/global/en.html) .

Research areas of interest: Safe human-computer interaction, Robotics, Reinforcement Learning,  Large language models.
