I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Department at Cornell University, advised by [Prof. Angelique Taylor](https://www.angeliquemtaylor.com/). My research focuses on **fairness-aware multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)** and **multi-objective optimization** for safety-critical applications, particularly in healthcare settings.

My current work develops [Fair-GNE (Fair Generalized Nash Equilibrium)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.14135), a constrained optimization framework using Lagrangian dual ascent for automatic penalty parameter learning in multi-agent systems with techniques applicable to RLHF and LLM alignment. I've also built [FairSkillMARL](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.18708) and [MARLHospital](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.14135), a customizable simulation environment for evaluating fairness-efficiency trade-offs in multi-agent healthcare automation. My research combines game theory, Nash equilibrium, and large-scale distributed training on HPC clusters.

My past research includes investigating [emergent persuasiveness in large language models](https://ece.princeton.edu/people/jaime-fernandez-fisac) (GPT-J, ChatGPT, GPT-3) and Explainable AI (XAI) for safety-critical systems. I completed my M.S.E. in Computer Science at [Princeton University](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/) in 2023, supervised by [Prof. Jaime Fernández Fisac](https://ece.princeton.edu/people/jaime-fernandez-fisac). Before joining Cornell, I spent eleven weeks as an AI Safety intern at [Siemens Technology](https://www.siemens.com/global/en.html), developing explainable AI frameworks for medical diagnosis systems.

**Research interests:** Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning, Fairness in AI, Post-Training & Alignment (RLHF, DPO), Multi-Objective Optimization, Large Language Models, AI Safety.
