# Hello there, I'm Promise!

# Hello there, I'm Promise!

I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Department at Cornell University, advised by [Prof. Angelique Taylor](https://www.angeliquemtaylor.com/).  My Ph.D. research focuses on **fairness-aware multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)** and **multi-objective optimization** for safety-critical applications, particularly in healthcare settings where effective coordination between heterogeneous agents is crucial.

My current work centers on developing [Fair-GNE (Fair Generalized Nash Equilibrium)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.14135), a novel constrained optimization framework using Lagrangian dual ascent for automatic penalty parameter learning. This approach addresses fairness-efficiency trade-offs in multi-agent systems and has direct applications to RLHF and alignment in large language models. I've also developed [FairSkillMARL](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.18708), which establishes principled fairness and reward modeling frameworks for MARL that bridge the gap between algorithmic definitions and real-world equity considerations. To enable reproducible evaluation of these methods, I built [MARLHospital](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.14135), a customizable simulation environment featuring heterogeneous agents with varying skills and energy levels performing coordinated medical procedures like CPR, rescue breathing, and equipment handling.

My research combines rigorous theoretical foundations (game theory, KKT conditions, Nash equilibrium) with large-scale distributed training experiments across 200+ concurrent GPU jobs on HPC clusters. I'm particularly interested in the mathematical connections between multi-agent coordination and LLM post-training, where similar optimization frameworks (Lagrangian methods, multi-objective optimization) address alignment challenges in both domains.

My past research projects range from using a game-theoretic approach and reinforcement learning algorithms to study [emergent persuasiveness in large language models](https://ece.princeton.edu/people/jaime-fernandez-fisac) such as GPT-J, dolly GPT-J, ChatGPT and GPT-3, to Explainable AI (XAI) and AI safety. I completed my Masters in Science of Engineering in the department of Computer Science at [Princeton University](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/) in 2023, supervised by [Prof. Jaime Fernández Fisac](https://ece.princeton.edu/people/jaime-fernandez-fisac). Before that, I received my B.Eng from University of Benin, Nigeria. Before joining Cornell in Summer 2023, I spent eleven weeks as an AI Safety and verification intern doing R&D work at [Siemens Technology](https://www.siemens.com/global/en.html), where I developed explainable AI frameworks for graph neural network medical diagnosis systems.

Research areas of interest: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning, Fairness in AI, Post-Training & Alignment (RLHF, DPO), Multi-Objective Optimization, Large Language Models, Robotics, AI Safety.
