title: "Explainable AI (XAI) with Deep learning and Knowledge Graphs"
excerpt: "This project was focused on providing explanation to the recommendations of graph-based machine learning models for medical diagnosis. This project was focused on providing explanation to the recommendations of graph-based machine learning models for medical diagnosis. It featured running GNNExplainer on predictions from graph attention networks to come up with detailed explanations after disease inference. my main contribution was building algorithms for two XAI experiments on real-world datasets & random datasets for proof of concept."
